<title>Does the offline Quest interpreter offer any features to players that online play does not?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1181/offline-quest-interpreter-offer-features-players-online-does</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;IFDB doesn't seem to have instructions for how to play Quest story files, but I assume this is what you'd use--desktop version of Quest: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://textadventures.co.uk/quest/desktop&quot;&gt;http://textadventures.co.uk/quest/desktop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If not, please let me know!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the desktop interpreter offer any features to players that you don't get when you play a Quest game online?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, is there any special reason to download the desktop interpreter if you're just planning to play a Quest game, not make one?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Flowers for Algernon. What to do?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1174/flowers-for-algernon-what-to-do</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Behold, the most stupid question in ifanswers to date:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply can't do whatever this &quot;demo&quot; from the 1998 TextFire joke expects me to. I discovered some 'vurbs' like 'examin', 'tak', 'reed', and so on... but I can't open the door! Is it even possible to open the door?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have played other of those &quot;demos&quot;, and they at least ended somehow, so I'm expecting that it is possible to reach the end of this one.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Alternative ways to interact with I7 stories?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/867/alternative-ways-to-interact-with-i7-stories</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I would like to be able to take existing I7 stories, and play them outside of the standard I7 GUI.  The primary motivation for this is that I would like to integrate an I7 story into a chat bot.  This would allow myself and some friends to play the story together over chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already have a chat bot which I have written in python.  I would like to be able to feed text input to I7 and have it return the response as text.  Any suggestions on which tools from the I7 toolset apply to me, or where I might start?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In Quest, will save files from an older game work with a newer verison of a game?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/803/quest-will-save-files-older-game-work-with-newer-verison-game</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Let's you're playing v1.0.0 and get about halfway done and then v1.0.1 comes out, can you continue where you left off using the same file or does a save file link to a game where when you open it, it reads as the version you originally started with?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Who is the author of sample project 'Onyx' which comes with the Inform7 desktop client?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/567/author-sample-project-which-comes-with-inform7-desktop-client</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I am referring to the short sample based on that Slavic folk tale. I'd just love to read more IF by the same author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to find out that the other sample project ('Disenchantment Bay') was written by Emily Short. I would assume same goes for Onyx but it seems impossible to confirm. Does anybody know for sure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How can I organize games I've played and want to play?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/458/how-can-i-organize-games-ive-played-and-want-to-play</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;While the simple solution is put all played games in one folder and all unplayed in another, I know that there are apps that track things, too, that allow for more detail. I'd be interested in hearing the pluses and minuses of each of those, because I don't know, and having the two folders hasn't quite worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also, IFDB is a good resource, until the list of &quot;want to play&quot; games becomes too long and unwieldy. This is a case where a good GUI would seem to help a lot.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why doesn't clicking work in the offline Quest player?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/256/why-doesnt-clicking-work-in-the-offline-quest-player</link>
<description>Was trying to search the forums and bug reports but none of my search terms were taking 100%.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'll download a game, then can't get past the first &amp;quot;Continue&amp;quot; because the click isn't registering in the offline player.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Win 8 / &amp;nbsp;Quest 5.6 (Build 5.6.5514.32136)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Upon Program Launch, the Play Tab is active. I click to download any of the games - &amp;quot;The Lunastone&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Victorian Detective 2&amp;quot; for example. They download fine. The Download switches to &amp;quot;Play&amp;quot;. Clicking Play starts the game, inventroy loads, music loads, images load, but at this point in the process, I can click, even select text, but it's as if the clicks aren't registering in the window.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No problems playing in a web browser. Just wanted to figure out what was wrong.</description>

<title>Which mapping tools work on Mac?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/202/which-mapping-tools-work-on-mac</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;What software or tools do you use to map out rooms in IF? Both when you're playing and when you're writing. It's been hard to find something which works on Mac natively, and I would love some kind of tool which can produce a map like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://daftjunk.com/dw/Ankh-Morpork.png&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Have tried Inform 7's tool but I'd like something which I can draft out spaces with before writing them in.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In Chlorophyll, are there too many locations?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/115/in-chlorophyll-are-there-too-many-locations</link>
<description>The game Chlorophyll is an adventure on a new planet. But are there too many locations in the game?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is there a maximum number of locations it is fun to explore? And a number (less) it is fun to solve puzzles in (because you will need to try every location if you don't know the next step)? I'm interested to poll players' and designers' opinions.&lt;br /&gt;

<title>In Terminator are the crew real or a fantasy?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/114/in-terminator-are-the-crew-real-or-a-fantasy</link>
<description>The protagonist of Terminator barely mentions the crew. We never see or hear a specific description of any particular person. Is it possible that the protagonist is alone and only imagines crewmates?&lt;br /&gt;
