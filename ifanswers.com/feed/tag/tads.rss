<title>Is there a Javascript Interpreter for TADS that I can run on my website?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/774/there-javascript-interpreter-for-tads-that-can-run-website</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a website, and I want people to be able to play my adventure from my webpage. Is there source code available for a javascript TADS that I could run on my website? I know IFDB has a &quot;play online&quot; web interpreter, but idk what it is / where it is / how I would use it with my website&lt;/p&gt;

<title>TADS3 - How to suppress output</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/652/tads3-how-to-suppress-output</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;So I've migrated to TADS, and I seem to have a lot of flexibility and everything is wonderful. The trouble is, I can't seem to find the equivalent of Inform7's &quot;Reject the player's command;&quot; in TADS3. How can I suppress arbitrary outputs?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Can I export / translate an adventure written with I7 to TADS?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/604/can-i-export-translate-an-adventure-written-with-i7-to-tads</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote the first half of a game in Inform 7, but I've learned about TADS which I like so much so much so much more (I got to compile my own interpreter!). Is there a way to convert the logic of I7 &quot;code&quot; to the C-like TADS format? I presume that the parsing stage for either is probably quite different, but I6 looks kindof similar... Perhaps compiling I7 down to I6 or something. IDK. &lt;/p&gt;
