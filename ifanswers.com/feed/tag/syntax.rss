<title>Is there syntax to allow multiple expressions in the same script?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/846/there-syntax-to-allow-multiple-expressions-the-same-script</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm working a Star Trek game and am using a &quot;say&quot; command for the Turblolift. Everything is working fine, but I worry I'm facing a situation where I'll need to create a new script for every possible spelling or capitalization (We're using the web GUI for this whole project and won't be copy/pasting any code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I want the commands for &quot;Deck 6, deck 6, Engineering, engineering&quot; to all send the player to the same location, is there syntax I can use to include it all on one line? Apologies if the answer is in the tutorials; everything I've found that seems relevant results in errors.&lt;/p&gt;
