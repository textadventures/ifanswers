<title>Who is the author of sample project 'Onyx' which comes with the Inform7 desktop client?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/567/author-sample-project-which-comes-with-inform7-desktop-client</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I am referring to the short sample based on that Slavic folk tale. I'd just love to read more IF by the same author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to find out that the other sample project ('Disenchantment Bay') was written by Emily Short. I would assume same goes for Onyx but it seems impossible to confirm. Does anybody know for sure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
