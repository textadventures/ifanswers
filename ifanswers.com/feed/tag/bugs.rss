<title>Should I use the forums to alert people to a bug I noticed?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/301/should-i-use-the-forums-to-alert-people-to-a-bug-i-noticed</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I recently spent an hour commenting and uncommenting every block of my code trying to find the source of a &quot;bug&quot;. I just discovered it wasn't a bug. I thought I did something to cause the statusbar to disappear, but apparently, if the Inform window isn't tall enough, it will stop rendering the statusbar when text / commands reach the bottom of the space. It disappears exactly as it would if code fouled it up, but it's just the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I alert people to this really irritating &quot;bug&quot;, or is the bug report enough? There seem to be a whole lot of bugs reported, and so I'm afraid someone else might waste their time like this, because my bug report is lost in a sea of other ones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I'm still getting used to the etiquette here, so if this isn't the place for this, I apologize in advance.)&lt;/p&gt;
