<title>Where does Twine delete stories to?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1138/where-does-twine-delete-stories-to</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I accidentally deleted the wrong story file in Twine (I had one that kept duplicating, I deleted the older one, and now somehow the newer one is gone). Where does the client delete the files to? So far, my undeleters have found nothing and my recycle bin has been empty all this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I knew where the files go, I can look for it there, but it certainly isn't the recycle bin or the Twine folder in 'my documents'.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How can I add changing maps or inventories to a Twine game?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/584/how-can-i-add-changing-maps-or-inventories-to-a-twine-game</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of having a changing map in a Twine  story. Something like a diagram which will change according to the passages you've visited, like a roguelike. Alternatively, I want to have a sidebar which will display an inventory or something like that, like in Kerkerkruip or in RPGs such as Sil. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this feasible and/or possible? Do you have any ideas how I might go about doing it? (Would it be a lot easier in another language like Inform 7?) Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twine with sugarcube: can you display visited links differently?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/477/twine-with-sugarcube-you-display-visited-links-differently</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://twinery.org/&quot;&gt;Twine&lt;/a&gt; (1.4) using the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/&quot;&gt;Sugarcube&lt;/a&gt; story format, is there some way to display links to visited passages so they look different from unvisited links? They are &quot;a&quot; html anchors, but using a an &lt;code&gt;a:visited&lt;/code&gt; css selector does not cut it, I assume because the linking is done using javascript &quot;click&quot; events, not standard browser linking.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How do I pass variables between Twine and javascript?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/471/how-do-i-pass-variables-between-twine-and-javascript</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;How do I pass variables between Twine and javascript? Is this different for different versions of Twine and/or different story formats?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Twine 1.4 using the Sugarcane story format, Twine variables are in &lt;code&gt;state.history[0].variables&lt;/code&gt; javascript variable, but with SugarCube I guess they are somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twine: Is there a macro or something to automatically go to another passage?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/441/twine-there-macro-something-automatically-another-passage</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Playing around with Twine 1.4, I was looking for something like &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;if (some condition)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;goto &quot;passage&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;endif&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there some way to do this, or some other pattern for doing this?&lt;/p&gt;
