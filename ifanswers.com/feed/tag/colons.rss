<title>How can I have a colon as part of a room name?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/865/how-can-i-have-a-colon-as-part-of-a-room-name</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I want to use a colon in the name of a room (e.g. Briefing room: Midday) but every time I7 sees the colon it assumes I want to provide a definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Inform 6 there were certain characters substituted for others (such as the tilde for quotation marks to allow speech to be represented inside of a piece of text), so I'm guessing the answer lies along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've looked in the General Index but can't find anything under 'colon', 'punctuation' or 'substitute'.  Punctuation has a sub entry &quot;apostrophe, meaning quotation mark&quot; which again makes me think there's some other character I can use instead.&lt;/p&gt;
