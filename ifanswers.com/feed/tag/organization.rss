<title>How can I organize games I've played and want to play?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/458/how-can-i-organize-games-ive-played-and-want-to-play</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;While the simple solution is put all played games in one folder and all unplayed in another, I know that there are apps that track things, too, that allow for more detail. I'd be interested in hearing the pluses and minuses of each of those, because I don't know, and having the two folders hasn't quite worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also, IFDB is a good resource, until the list of &quot;want to play&quot; games becomes too long and unwieldy. This is a case where a good GUI would seem to help a lot.)&lt;/p&gt;
