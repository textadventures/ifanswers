<title>How can I add changing maps or inventories to a Twine game?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/584/how-can-i-add-changing-maps-or-inventories-to-a-twine-game</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of having a changing map in a Twine  story. Something like a diagram which will change according to the passages you've visited, like a roguelike. Alternatively, I want to have a sidebar which will display an inventory or something like that, like in Kerkerkruip or in RPGs such as Sil. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this feasible and/or possible? Do you have any ideas how I might go about doing it? (Would it be a lot easier in another language like Inform 7?) Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
