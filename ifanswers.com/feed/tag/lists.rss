<title>Quest: &quot;Check Inventory&quot;</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/889/quest-check-inventory</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey All,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to make a Command in quest, where the player can type Check Inventory, and it will list the player inventory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only problem is, I'm used to only using the basics of the Quest program, and I know nothing about 'Variable, Object, Attribute and Function' which I assume have something to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone got any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I'm doing this, is because I want to use the 'Retro' theme, and get rid of the pane at the right, as it does not blend in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How do I work with lists in Quest?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/854/how-do-i-work-with-lists-in-quest</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Within the Quest tool, how would I go about working with lists?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had answers with instructions in code form, but since I'm pretty new to this, I have no clue what to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;
