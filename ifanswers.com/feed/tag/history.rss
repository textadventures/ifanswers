<title>Can we know a little more about the story of the Quest system? [Quest]</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1044/can-we-know-little-more-about-the-story-the-quest-system-quest</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;br&gt;
I am writing a PHD dissertation about interactive fiction tools and I find it difficult to have information about Quest history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On IFDB, we can see Quest is the third most used writing tool but paradoxally it's very difficult to find documentation on it and it's more easy to find documentation on EAMON, AGT, GAC, Quill, PAW etc (and obviously for Inform, TADS, Twine, Adrift...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When was it created? On ifdb the first fiction begin in 2000. Who is the creator? Is there any documentation somewhere we can access?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for answering and sorry for my poor english (my dissertation is in french^^)&lt;/p&gt;
