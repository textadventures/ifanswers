<title>Is there an easy way to loop text in Inform 7?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1139/is-there-an-easy-way-to-loop-text-in-inform-7</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like there must be some simple method and I'm missing it (as usual). What I want is something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grazing is an action applying to nothing. &lt;br&gt;
Understand &quot;graze&quot; as grazing. &lt;br&gt;
Instead of grazing, say &quot;You eat an onion.&quot; then &quot;You nibble a carrot.&quot; then &quot;You consume a turnip.&quot; then &quot;You chomp a bagel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the programming syntax would look nothing like that, but I wrote it like that to convey the idea. After &quot;You chomp a bagel.&quot; is displayed, then it should loop back and say &quot;You eat an onion.&quot; and continue to loop indefinitely whenever the player uses the &quot;graze&quot; command. In that specific order: onion, carrot, turnip, bagel. Over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
