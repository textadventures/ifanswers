<title>In the&quot;What do you want to ... with?&quot; phrase, replace 'my' with 'your'.</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1122/in-the-what-do-you-want-to-with-phrase-replace-my-with-your</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have this in my source:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Understand &quot;brush my teeth with [something]&quot; as brushing teeth with.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, this happens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;brush my teeth
What do you want to brush my teeth with?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question &quot;What do you want...&quot;, I could not find it in the Rules, using the index. I would like it to change &quot;What do you want to brush MY teeth with?&quot; to &quot;What do you want to brush YOUR teeth with?&quot;. How can I fix this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I'm totally aware that expecting the player to brush his teeth in a game usually sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
