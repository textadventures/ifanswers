<title>Endless Loading [Quest]</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1039/endless-loading-quest</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I pressed 'Edit Game', as usual, expecting for the editor to pop up again.  It did, but it was completely blank and grayed out, with a big &quot;Loading . . . &quot; in the middle.  I can't work on it at all; I tried waiting, refreshing, re-logging, and even shutting off my computer, yet nothing will work.  It still says &quot;Loading . . .&quot; right now, how do I get my project back?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How can I run a command via script? [Quest]</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1025/how-can-i-run-a-command-via-script-quest</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Title is quite self-explanatory. I want to have a script that runs a command for me so the user doesn't have to type it. More specifically I want it to use the &quot;look&quot; command so all the information about the room I defined in the game settings is displayed over again.&lt;/p&gt;
