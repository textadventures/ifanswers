<title>Does the offline Quest interpreter offer any features to players that online play does not?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1181/offline-quest-interpreter-offer-features-players-online-does</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;IFDB doesn't seem to have instructions for how to play Quest story files, but I assume this is what you'd use--desktop version of Quest: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://textadventures.co.uk/quest/desktop&quot;&gt;http://textadventures.co.uk/quest/desktop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If not, please let me know!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the desktop interpreter offer any features to players that you don't get when you play a Quest game online?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, is there any special reason to download the desktop interpreter if you're just planning to play a Quest game, not make one?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Alternative ways to interact with I7 stories?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/867/alternative-ways-to-interact-with-i7-stories</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I would like to be able to take existing I7 stories, and play them outside of the standard I7 GUI.  The primary motivation for this is that I would like to integrate an I7 story into a chat bot.  This would allow myself and some friends to play the story together over chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already have a chat bot which I have written in python.  I would like to be able to feed text input to I7 and have it return the response as text.  Any suggestions on which tools from the I7 toolset apply to me, or where I might start?&lt;/p&gt;
