<title>How does one properly format italics/bold text in title entries in Menus by Emily Short?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/590/properly-format-italics-text-title-entries-menus-emily-short</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm noticing some odd behavior when italicizing and bolding text in the title entries of a menu  created by the Menus extension in Glulx. Consider this code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Include Menus by Emily Short.

Blank is a room.

When play begins:
    now the current menu is the Table of Issue;
    carry out the displaying activity;
    clear the screen.

Table of Issue
title   subtable    description toggle
&quot;Foo&quot;   --  &quot;&quot;  --
&quot;[italic type]Bar[roman type]&quot;  --  &quot;&quot;  --
&quot;Baz&quot;   --  &quot;&quot;  --
&quot;Qux&quot;   --  &quot;&quot;  --
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the game proper, the menu titles after the italicized one have a different style and aren't indented properly. This also happens for bold text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there are a way to use italics or bold text in titles while having the formatting remain consistent?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How do I use code formatting in posts on IF Answers?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/197/how-do-i-use-code-formatting-in-posts-on-if-answers</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have had not entirely an easy time figuring out how to format code properly in IFAnswers. I copied some code from the intfiction forum and it was automatically formatted as code, which was great, but then I couldn't figure out how to type anything that wasn't code &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; that and not have it formatted as code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually I typed some paragraph breaks in my non-code-formatted stuff and copy-pasted that whenever I needed to start a new paragraph that wasn't formatted as code, but that was less than ideal. Is there a simple HTMLish tag I can use for code formatting when typing a question/answer?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
