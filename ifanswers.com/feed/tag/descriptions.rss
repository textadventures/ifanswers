<title>Quest: if's, exits, blocking and attributes</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1254/quest-ifs-exits-blocking-and-attributes</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;So these forums have been very useful, thanks a ton for that.&lt;br&gt;
I've tried using gamebook version, but it seems rather limited, and I couldn't find dictionary functions to make attributes work properly and still so much more the text version does better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for Text Adventure Answers please**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So First Question is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you make page links available if a stat is high enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{if player.cunning&amp;gt;25:}&lt;br&gt;
I want the following to be displayed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{command:go to Room4: So cunning you get to go here!}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I'm adding the commands to the text description, and I can't quite get it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second Question:&lt;br&gt;
The next thing I am having trouble with is blocking a path (exit) after it has been used. &lt;br&gt;
Player has a choice of going to Room2, Room3, or Room4, player can't go to Room4 till their cunning is increased, so that isn't displayed yet, So player picks Room2, then Room2 links back to the Original Room1, but now I want Room2 to be blocked, that choice has already been taken and is no longer valid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've dabbled in exits and if's there as well, but can't quite get that right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Question (For Now)&lt;br&gt;
How do you display stats on a page without using the show panes interface? I'm looking to make it feel like more of a choose your own adventure, but with stats still recorded and shown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hopefully want it in descriptions, or maybe at header.&lt;br&gt;
 Maybe there is a way to have the option to remove inventory, compass, place and objects from the screen, but keep status?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any answer, would be very useful, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How do I display the full / initial room description when the player looks?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/296/display-the-full-initial-room-description-when-player-looks</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I want to have more descriptions of rooms when they're first entered, which is well handled by the usual [if unvisited] method.  I can then write a new, concise description in the [otherwise] section. This works well, but I want the player to be able to re-read the initial description if they want, i.e., when they explicitly ask to look at the room again. I can't seem to figure out how to reuse the initial description. I haven't tried, but I wouldn't think resetting the room to unvisited if they look is a good idea, as it might screw with other things that rely on knowing if the room is unvisited. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a good way to get this to happen while still having all the text nicely consolidated in the room's description, or will this require special rules and conditions? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pretty Landscape is a room. &quot;[if set to unabbreviated room descriptions]Rich, descriptive imagery![otherwise]You are here. You can do this and that.&quot;

Instead of looking:
    now use verbose descriptions;
    say room description;
    now use brief descriptions;
[this isn't flexible, it would rest whatever description setting was there initially]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
