<title>What are the exact details and relations concerning the player, yourself, and your former self in Inform 7?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/258/details-relations-concerning-player-yourself-former-inform</link>
<description>So, in my experience with Inform 7 I have observed three terms which I do not fully understand: the player, yourself, and your former self (the latter two change name in other story viewpoints, although the “self” in former self remains singular).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As far as I can tell, “the player” is a person that varies, “yourself” is the printed name of the current player character, and “your former self” is the default value that “the player” takes, which is a person who has a description of “As good-looking as ever.” The phrase “former self” is observed when you change the value of player without defining the original player as being a particular person. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Are there any subtle issues and exceptions concerning these that I should be aware of, particularly in games involving switching between characters?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
