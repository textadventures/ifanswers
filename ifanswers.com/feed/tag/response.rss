<title>How do I get the Inanimate Listener to respond to &quot;Computer, hello&quot;?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1179/how-get-the-inanimate-listener-to-respond-to-computer-hello</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking Computer about something, say &quot;'Voice print not recognised.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was expecting however that it would work for any comments directed at the computer, but it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASK COMPUTER ABOUT THE DOOR gets the right response but&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMPUTER, HELLO does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see that the second command is not an asking-type action.  I assume this is why it falls outside the rule we've made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a simple way to get the computer to respond to anything said to it?&lt;/p&gt;
