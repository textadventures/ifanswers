<title>How do I reliably put humor into a game?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/432/how-do-i-reliably-put-humor-into-a-game</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a tricky question, because people wonder if Humor is Good, or if it makes a game less serious, or if there is any particular humor suited to text adventures. But I'm curious what other people think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cop-out is don't force it, but don't avoid it. But I'm wondering about more detailed approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What are some factors to consider if someone's deciding whether/how to use profanity in IF?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/430/some-factors-consider-someones-deciding-whether-profanity</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Does it really make a writer look tough? When does it work, and when does it utterly fail? Will it totally turn people off? Is optional profanity an option?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: this is a loaded question as I'm usually opposed to it unless there's a good reason.)&lt;/p&gt;
