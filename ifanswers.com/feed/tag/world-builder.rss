<title>Engines with layered graphics?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/672/engines-with-layered-graphics</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite programs was &quot;World Builder&quot; for the Macintosh. It had a built in battle engine (that could be turned off) and support for layered graphics (IE drawing characters or objects in front of background or room pictures). Are there any other parser based engines that have &lt;strong&gt;simple&lt;/strong&gt; support for layered graphics? While AGS does support layered graphics it is more geared for creating click and point adventures like &quot;Monkey Island&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
