<title>How can I pace a game if I don't use score?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/142/how-can-i-pace-a-game-if-i-dont-use-score</link>
<description>One problem I have, as a player, is that a game isn't quite like a book--there's no way to see how big it is, so I can't be sure how much time to set aside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And since score isn't used as much now as in the old days, a new way seems courteous to offer the player. I've been surprised by stories ending too soon and left weary by (even very good) stories lasting longer than I thought.</description>
