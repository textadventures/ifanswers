<title>Help! I need to use a candle as a light source in rooms in my Quest text adventure game</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1223/help-need-candle-light-source-rooms-quest-text-adventure-game</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently making a fantasy game on Quest and a few of the rooms are dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want them to be dark when the player enters so they will have to use a candle (from the inventory) to light the room so they can move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't want them to be able to move on further into the room without using the candle but I cannot find this in the help documentation (although at the moment I am now going cross eyed with all the research and screenshots!!!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance! :)&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;I can't seem to find any tutorial or documentation that shows how quest handles light.&lt;/p&gt;
