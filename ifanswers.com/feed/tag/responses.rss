<title>Whence action processing internal rule response (J)?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/989/whence-action-processing-internal-rule-response-j</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I was pawing through the list of responses in the Standard Rules and I found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;action processing internal rule response (J): &quot;(Since something dramatic has happened, your list of commands has been cut short.)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gather that this interrupts an extended command along the lines of &quot;n. n. burn rope. jump.&quot; but I can't figure out what rule triggers this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does this response come from, and how can I use it to interrupt the players of my games?&lt;/p&gt;
