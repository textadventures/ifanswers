<title>How does one change the User Style for hyperlinks when using Flexible Windows?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1218/does-change-user-style-hyperlinks-when-using-flexible-windows</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been setting up all the styles for text (using Table of User Styles (continued) in my source, but haven't been able to figure out the style name for hyperlinks..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm primarily just trying to remove the blue colour to black, to match the rest of the text - remaining underlined is fine (though not preferable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there's no style name for hyperlinks (which is what I'm guessing now), how would one go about changing this font colour?&lt;/p&gt;
