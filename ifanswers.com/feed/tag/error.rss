<title>Quest: Game won't open for edit?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/823/quest-game-wont-open-for-edit</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been working on a Quest game for about  a month, and today have come to edit it, and it won't open. I get;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failed to load game due to the following errors;&lt;br&gt;
* Error: Error adding type 'editor&lt;em&gt;room' to element 'Crash Site': No element 'editor&lt;/em&gt;room' of type 'ObjectType'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My previous edit didn't add much, or particularly change much. Crash Site is the starting room for the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could open the Quest file, I could undo anything I did, or at least save most of the harder work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know how I can get it to open, in any way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I can't give the code, as I can't get it to open at all D:&lt;/p&gt;
