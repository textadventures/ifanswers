<title>Is there a way to edit tags in questions other than your own?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/685/is-there-a-way-to-edit-tags-in-questions-other-than-your-own</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people seem to forget to add a tag for the authoring system they're using. With enough reputation points you can edit the question text, but it seems that you can't add or edit tags. Is it possible and if not could the feature be added?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Can we add explanations to individual tags?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/470/can-we-add-explanations-to-individual-tags</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Problem: I see questions here tagged with &quot;Squiffy&quot;, but I don't even know what &quot;squiffy&quot; is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there some way to add an explanation to the tags? I would like it if I could hover over tags like on stackoverflow, but if there's no support for that then maybe we should just start adding questions like &quot;What is xxx?&quot; or &quot;Explain the tag xxx&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
