<title>Why doesn't clicking work in the offline Quest player?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/256/why-doesnt-clicking-work-in-the-offline-quest-player</link>
<description>Was trying to search the forums and bug reports but none of my search terms were taking 100%.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'll download a game, then can't get past the first &amp;quot;Continue&amp;quot; because the click isn't registering in the offline player.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Win 8 / &amp;nbsp;Quest 5.6 (Build 5.6.5514.32136)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Upon Program Launch, the Play Tab is active. I click to download any of the games - &amp;quot;The Lunastone&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Victorian Detective 2&amp;quot; for example. They download fine. The Download switches to &amp;quot;Play&amp;quot;. Clicking Play starts the game, inventroy loads, music loads, images load, but at this point in the process, I can click, even select text, but it's as if the clicks aren't registering in the window.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No problems playing in a web browser. Just wanted to figure out what was wrong.</description>
