<title>In Quest, how do I send an integer from javascript to Quest and keep it an integer?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/783/quest-how-send-integer-from-javascript-quest-and-keep-integer</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Let's say I have a Javascript function that gets the date, I used ParseInt but it still sends the variable as a string even though Javascript reads it as a variable but Quest reads it as a string.&lt;br&gt;
Is there a way to keep it as an integer or will anything Javascript sends to Quest be converted to a string?&lt;/p&gt;
