<title>How do I get the Inanimate Listener to respond to &quot;Computer, hello&quot;?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1179/how-get-the-inanimate-listener-to-respond-to-computer-hello</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking Computer about something, say &quot;'Voice print not recognised.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was expecting however that it would work for any comments directed at the computer, but it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASK COMPUTER ABOUT THE DOOR gets the right response but&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMPUTER, HELLO does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see that the second command is not an asking-type action.  I assume this is why it falls outside the rule we've made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a simple way to get the computer to respond to anything said to it?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>[Inform 7] How to implement a blanket 'not understood' comment for an Inanimate Listener</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1177/implement-blanket-understood-comment-inanimate-listener</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have two computers in different locations.  Both can be talked to thanks to the Inanimate Listener extension.  My intention is to have one computer that will accept commands from the player while the other will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't work out how to provide a universal &quot;I can't do that&quot; response from the stubborn computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking Stubborn_Computer about anything, say &quot;'Voice print not recognised.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't work because Inform regards 'anything' as a specific topic rather than a global 'everything'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
