<title>How can I run a command via script? [Quest]</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1025/how-can-i-run-a-command-via-script-quest</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Title is quite self-explanatory. I want to have a script that runs a command for me so the user doesn't have to type it. More specifically I want it to use the &quot;look&quot; command so all the information about the room I defined in the game settings is displayed over again.&lt;/p&gt;
