<title>In the latest Inform ATTACK how do you write a First standard_attacker rule?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/107/the-latest-inform-attack-write-first-standard_attacker-rule</link>
<description>Converting an old project which uses ?version 3 of Inform ATTACK, to the latest Inform ATTACK (version 5). This rule is causing a problem:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Problem. You wrote 'First standard_attacker rule' : again, the punctuation here ':' makes me think this should be a definition of a phrase and it doesn't begin as it should.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This problem report implies that the named rule doesn't match any definition in version 5 of Inform ATTACK. I believe that there may be an equivalent rule with a different name or perhaps the rule should be written in a different way like a check rule.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can find the latest Inform ATTACK here:&lt;br /&gt;
