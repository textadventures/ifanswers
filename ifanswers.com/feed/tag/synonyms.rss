<title>How do I make verbs synonymous for only certain objects in Quest 5.6.1?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1213/how-do-make-verbs-synonymous-for-only-certain-objects-quest</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm a beginner at this. And I just discovered library elements as I was typing this question, so I'm sorry if I'm right at the answer now. But I've spent too much time on this already and I think other people would wonder this, too. I'll post the answer if I figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using the Quest 5.6.1 windows program, I'm not using the browser version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my game, there is a book. I've given the book &quot;one&quot; verb that has many synonyms. It's this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;turn through; flip through; scan; read; open; thumb through; page through; look in; look inside&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that one of the synonyms is &quot;open&quot;. More recently, I added my first container object to the game. One of it's default verbs is &quot;open&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I try to open it with the &quot;open&quot; verb, it says this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't turn through; flip through; scan; read; open; thumb through; page through; look in; look inside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an experiment, I wanted to try giving the verb &quot;open&quot; to an object that isn't a container and see if I have the same problem, but when I type &quot;open&quot; and click the ok button, it comes up as &quot;turn through; flip through; scan; read; open; thumb through; page through; look in; look inside&quot;, even though I only typed &quot;open&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I think you can tell what my intentions are. I would like for the player to be able to use any of those words to open; read; etc. the book. I don't want the player to type something that to a human being clearly means that they want to open the book and read its pages and have the game tell them that it doesn't know how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I make the words in my verb string synonymous only for one object, in this case, the book?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if I could create a designation (a flag, maybe?) for every object that I would want this string to apply to, in other words, books, magazines; any reading material composed of pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this isn't a stupid question. I've been looking all over the place to solve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for giving me your time.&lt;/p&gt;
