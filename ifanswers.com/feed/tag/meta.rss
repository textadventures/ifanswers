<title>On IF Answers, should comments be hidden after edits are made to a question or answer?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/403/answers-should-comments-hidden-after-edits-question-answer</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Some of these questions are getting a lot of comments. In cases where people comment to make suggestions for a question or answer, and the question/answer is then edited accordingly, do you hide the comments?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>On IF Answers, should the question itself mention the development system?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/266/answers-should-question-itself-mention-development-system</link>
<description>If it would be helpful I can edit some of the existing questions to add, for instance, &amp;quot;in Inform 7&amp;quot; to the actual question, in cases where the development system is mentioned only in the tag or in the additional info.</description>

<title>How do I use code formatting in posts on IF Answers?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/197/how-do-i-use-code-formatting-in-posts-on-if-answers</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have had not entirely an easy time figuring out how to format code properly in IFAnswers. I copied some code from the intfiction forum and it was automatically formatted as code, which was great, but then I couldn't figure out how to type anything that wasn't code &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; that and not have it formatted as code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually I typed some paragraph breaks in my non-code-formatted stuff and copy-pasted that whenever I needed to start a new paragraph that wasn't formatted as code, but that was less than ideal. Is there a simple HTMLish tag I can use for code formatting when typing a question/answer?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Is this site accessible for vision impaired users?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/174/is-this-site-accessible-for-vision-impaired-users</link>
<description>I noticed that there is a flash CAPTCHA to check for robots. It is a gui checkbox. I did not see any alternative controls. I fear that it is not accessible to partially-sighted and blind users. The intfiction forum is partly accessible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm unable to reply to your comment Alex. The reply is: This answer put my fears at rest. I hope users will comment if there are accessibility problems.</description>

<title>Do questions on a development tool need to mention the version?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/12/do-questions-on-development-tool-need-to-mention-the-version</link>
<description>Since questions and answers are arranged topically instead of chronologically on a site like this, should questions about, say, Inform 7 mention/be tagged with the version the asker is using, for the sake of people searching the site in the future?</description>
