<title>Is it against the player's expectation to have examine do more senses than just sight?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/233/against-players-expectation-examine-senses-than-just-sight</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;EXAMINE THING and LOOK AT THING are conventionally the same command, and they conventionally give you the description of the thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m wondering is whether descriptions should focus solely on sight, or if descriptions ought to include noises and possibly odor as well (provided it isn’t an odor you would have to sniff up close to observe, perhaps). It feels odd to me to have to use up two turns to X THING and then LISTEN TO THING when if you were really there you’d experience both at once, but at the same time I’m sure some players would find it odd to see non-sight information after examining, and if it is all bundled into one command what is the point of the others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I’m asking this is because I’m experimenting with alternate primary senses as well. If you were, say, a dog whose primary sense is smell but who still sees, it would seem unusual to have to use up two turns to SMELL THING and then LOOK AT THING to get all the info, even if both are timeless. It feels to me that EXAMINE THING would best fuse both together, but then you have to consider what SMELL THING and LOOK AT THING do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you feel you would want as a player, and why? What would you think naturally and what would you require ABOUT text guidance to understand?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How can I pace a game if I don't use score?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/142/how-can-i-pace-a-game-if-i-dont-use-score</link>
<description>One problem I have, as a player, is that a game isn't quite like a book--there's no way to see how big it is, so I can't be sure how much time to set aside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And since score isn't used as much now as in the old days, a new way seems courteous to offer the player. I've been surprised by stories ending too soon and left weary by (even very good) stories lasting longer than I thought.</description>

<title>In Chlorophyll, are there too many locations?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/115/in-chlorophyll-are-there-too-many-locations</link>
<description>The game Chlorophyll is an adventure on a new planet. But are there too many locations in the game?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is there a maximum number of locations it is fun to explore? And a number (less) it is fun to solve puzzles in (because you will need to try every location if you don't know the next step)? I'm interested to poll players' and designers' opinions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
