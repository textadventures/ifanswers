<title>How do I debug in Inform 7?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/353/how-do-i-debug-in-inform-7</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Plastering &quot;say&quot; all over works, but it has some risks: this code may seep into a release version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I type to narrow down where something is not quite working, with a parser command or with code?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How do I debug in Quest?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/352/how-do-i-debug-in-quest</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I'd be interested in reading about basic debugging techniques beyond just throwing in text you need to remove later so the player doesn't see it. Because debugging is one of those 5 dollar words that are not so bad once you know a few tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a parser command authors can use in a debug build? Is there something in Quest source that may say &quot;print to debug&quot; but not &quot;print?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
