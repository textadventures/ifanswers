<title>Is there an easy way to port Inform 6 code (unfinished game) into Inform 7 to continue development?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/754/there-inform-unfinished-game-inform-continue-development</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been working on a game in I6 off and on for many years.  I'd love to shift it over to I7 but doing it manually seems a daunting task.  I have working code and also a compiled .z8 file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seem to remember that when Inform 7 was first released, there was a way to port I6 code to I7, but only for Mac.  (I'm on PC, by the way.)  I don't think even that exists anymore so I'm expecting the answer 'no', but one lives in hope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, is there a rough guide for how to approach a conversion? &lt;/p&gt;
