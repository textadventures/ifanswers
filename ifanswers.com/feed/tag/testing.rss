<title>How do I keep testing from becoming boring, for my games or others'?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/35/how-do-keep-testing-from-becoming-boring-for-games-or-others</link>
<description>Testing is something everyone knows needs to be done, but it can be hard to do it. There's a sameness to it that can be dreadful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also I find myself thinking in &amp;quot;don't think of a bear&amp;quot; terms of this. If I worry testing will be boring, it becomes boring. So if you've thought of it this way, rephrase it into, how can I get testing to try something new?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Side confession: I've put off potentially repetitive testing of my games and others' with playing FreeCell, which is itself repetitive. Even recognizing this is a help--I think.)</description>
