<title>Help! I need to use a candle as a light source in rooms in my Quest text adventure game</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1223/help-need-candle-light-source-rooms-quest-text-adventure-game</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently making a fantasy game on Quest and a few of the rooms are dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want them to be dark when the player enters so they will have to use a candle (from the inventory) to light the room so they can move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't want them to be able to move on further into the room without using the candle but I cannot find this in the help documentation (although at the moment I am now going cross eyed with all the research and screenshots!!!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance! :)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>re-arrange rooms</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1220/re-arrange-rooms</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;How do I re-arrange rooms on the Web-Based software? I.e. I have a room, but want another room to be the starting room. How can I make it so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Quest mind you***&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How do I display the full / initial room description when the player looks?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/296/display-the-full-initial-room-description-when-player-looks</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I want to have more descriptions of rooms when they're first entered, which is well handled by the usual [if unvisited] method.  I can then write a new, concise description in the [otherwise] section. This works well, but I want the player to be able to re-read the initial description if they want, i.e., when they explicitly ask to look at the room again. I can't seem to figure out how to reuse the initial description. I haven't tried, but I wouldn't think resetting the room to unvisited if they look is a good idea, as it might screw with other things that rely on knowing if the room is unvisited. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a good way to get this to happen while still having all the text nicely consolidated in the room's description, or will this require special rules and conditions? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pretty Landscape is a room. &quot;[if set to unabbreviated room descriptions]Rich, descriptive imagery![otherwise]You are here. You can do this and that.&quot;

Instead of looking:
    now use verbose descriptions;
    say room description;
    now use brief descriptions;
[this isn't flexible, it would rest whatever description setting was there initially]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
