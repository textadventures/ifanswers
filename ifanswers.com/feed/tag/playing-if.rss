<title>Flowers for Algernon. What to do?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/1174/flowers-for-algernon-what-to-do</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Behold, the most stupid question in ifanswers to date:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply can't do whatever this &quot;demo&quot; from the 1998 TextFire joke expects me to. I discovered some 'vurbs' like 'examin', 'tak', 'reed', and so on... but I can't open the door! Is it even possible to open the door?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have played other of those &quot;demos&quot;, and they at least ended somehow, so I'm expecting that it is possible to reach the end of this one.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How can I organize games I've played and want to play?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/458/how-can-i-organize-games-ive-played-and-want-to-play</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;While the simple solution is put all played games in one folder and all unplayed in another, I know that there are apps that track things, too, that allow for more detail. I'd be interested in hearing the pluses and minuses of each of those, because I don't know, and having the two folders hasn't quite worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also, IFDB is a good resource, until the list of &quot;want to play&quot; games becomes too long and unwieldy. This is a case where a good GUI would seem to help a lot.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In Chlorophyll, are there too many locations?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/115/in-chlorophyll-are-there-too-many-locations</link>
<description>The game Chlorophyll is an adventure on a new planet. But are there too many locations in the game?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is there a maximum number of locations it is fun to explore? And a number (less) it is fun to solve puzzles in (because you will need to try every location if you don't know the next step)? I'm interested to poll players' and designers' opinions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

<title>In Terminator are the crew real or a fantasy?</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/114/in-terminator-are-the-crew-real-or-a-fantasy</link>
<description>The protagonist of Terminator barely mentions the crew. We never see or hear a specific description of any particular person. Is it possible that the protagonist is alone and only imagines crewmates?&lt;br /&gt;

If you are the author of the work, identify yourself to readers. Sorry, I'm unable to reply to your comment dannii. I'm not sure that plot-explanation is a good tag.</description>
