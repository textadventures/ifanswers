<title>Stopping timer Event with Key Press</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/897/stopping-timer-event-with-key-press</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I new to Quest (but really enjoying it). I would like to create really, really simple combat (much simpler than the kit). By having a turn event (with a timer) when you enter a room (e.g. 'Cyborg attacks you' - if this happens 3 times with one monster you die) and having a key press (e.g. press 'Enter' or 'x') to stop this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am having trouble finding how to do a key press to stop a timer event. Actually to be honest I don't know how to do a key press to do anything. I would also like to have key presses with sounds assigned to different keys in different rooms to trigger sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hopeless with anything coding related - is there a simple way to do this. I assume there is but I just am having trouble finding it. Thanks for your help.&lt;/p&gt;
