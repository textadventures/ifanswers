<title>Ascii Art, Images and Music when publishing</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/913/ascii-art-images-and-music-when-publishing</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I assume the main places for publishing IF are through the text adventures site, through ifdb (often played through frotz) or as a separate website or app(converting html to an app).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering about using images, ascii art and music across different publishing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does Frotz for iphone, iPad and Android support audio? I haven't played any IF that has used sound , images or ascii art using Frotz but I was unsure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am considering building a text adenture that uses lots of glitchy electronic music in different sections but wanted to find out if it would translate across different platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone tried making a quest game (with music or images), changing the html to an app through 'Phonegap'. Have you had any success with this? I was just keen to explore this and wondered if anyone had tried it so I could learn from any mistakes or limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
