<title>Quest Gamebook: Return to a previous page with multiple links, and make link already chosen inactive</title>
<link>http://ifanswers.com/935/gamebook-return-previous-multiple-already-chosen-inactive</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm new to Quest and know next to nothing about programming. I'm trying my best, but sometimes it all sounds like gibberish to me. I tried to search the forums for an answer to my probably simple question, but I think I ended up confusing myself even more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to figure out the easiest way to basically backtrack and then block out a link from a list of options when you reach that page again. For example, the player can choose to sneak into the kitchen, talk to a barmaid, or talk to an adventurer. Say the player sneaks into the kitchen first, finds out what he/she needs to, but then has nowhere else to go. So they go back out to the tavern scene they started at, and from there, I want the other two options to be still available, while the first one no longer be a clickable link (or if you click it, it gives you a message that you've already done everything here or something and takes you back to the other options again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've tried the &quot;If&quot; script hoping that I can tag each link when a player first chooses that option. Then if the player has seen the page/has a counter, when they get back to the the page that has all the choices, the link they already have followed is just text. Or if they haven't seen that page/have that counter, the link is still viable. That didn't seem to work for multiple &quot;the player has already seen page if&quot; options. It seemed to only spit out the message for the page they did see and didn't show the link for the pages they player hadn't already seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if I could somehow use the &quot;first time&quot; script instead to get an active link to disappear after the player has already chosen it and then circled back? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I was wondering if somebody could explain the &quot;Add page link&quot; script, because I think I'm confusing myself over that as well. Every time I try to use it, I get nothing when I try to play through the game. (Or maybe I'm just using it wrong. I was trying to use it above with the &quot;if&quot; script. For example, if have seen page, display message. But if not seen page, add active link for an option for the player to pick.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any help, and patience, you can offer this confused newbie!&lt;/p&gt;
